Requirements:
The calculator is able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations with two numbers: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b. Data is passed in a single string (see the example below). Solutions where each number and arithmetic operation are entered on a new line are considered incorrect.
The calculator can work with both Arabic (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...) and Roman (I, II, III, IV, V...) numerals.
The calculator should accept input numbers from 1 to 10 inclusive. The output numbers are not limited in size and can be any.
The calculator can only work with integers.
The calculator can only work with either Arabic or Roman digits at a time. If the user enters a string like "3 + II," the calculator should indicate an error and stop working.
When entering Roman numerals, the answer should be displayed in Roman numerals. Similarly, when entering Arabic numerals, the answer is expected to be in Arabic numerals.
When the user enters unsuitable numbers, the application displays an error in the terminal and stops working.
When the user enters a string that does not correspond to one of the described arithmetic operations, the application displays an error and stops working.
The result of division should be an integer; the remainder is discarded.
The result of working with Arabic numerals may be negative numbers and zero. The result of working with Roman numerals can only be positive numbers. If the result is less than one, the program should indicate an exception.
